# Earthquake Building Damage Detection based on Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery and Machine Learning

This python codebase and set of Jupyter notebooks presents a framework for semi-automated building damage assessment due to earthquakes from remote sensing data and other supplementary datasets including high-resolution building inventories, while also leveraging recent advances in machine-learning algorithms.
